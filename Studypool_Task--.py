# Create a program that allows the user to do some basic functions.
# First, ask the user if they would like to find out sqrt, log or factorial of a number, then return the results.
# Here is the sample output:
# Welcome to the simple math helper.
# What would you like to calculate?
# 1. Sqrt
# 2. Log
# 3. Factorial
# > 1
# Enter the number to sqrt:
# >9
# 3
